# ferret

**ferret** is a modern client for the [gopher protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). Currently (0.2.0) only Linux is supported.

## Building from source
To build, you'll need cmake, which you can get from your package manager or https://cmake.org/.

(Previous versions of ferret required **libui**, but this requirement has been dropped in favour of **GTK**.)

*cd* into the directory where you placed the ferret source, then run

	./build.sh

and you're good to go!
